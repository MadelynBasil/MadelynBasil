- 👋 Hi, I’m Basil! Or Madelyn, or Flux, or… let's just go with Basil! UwU
- 👀 I’m interested in lots of things, but I've done all of nothing for awhile now. I guess my primary thing at the moment would be game development. Wanna make a roguelike.
- 🌱 I’m currently tinkering with libtcod and unrelatedly, Godot. Fun stuff.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on… well, nothings atm, because I'm shy! But if you want to feel free to reach out <3
- 📫 Best bet for reaching me is on discord as feralflux!
